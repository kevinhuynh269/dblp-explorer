How i designed my hw 

i did a nested for loop so O(N^2) lol, when i did is a have an linked list of all the json objects and i would
go into the linked list and compare if the keyword is the same then i printed out the first tier and the stored the references
after i store the references i did a while loop so i can traverse down that list n times so what i figured i needed was two linked lists,
one so that i could compare it
