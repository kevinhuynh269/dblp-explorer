How i designed my hw 

i did a nested for loop so O(N^2) lol, when i did is a have an linked list of all the json objects and i would
go into the linked list and compare if the keyword is the same then i printed out the first tier and the stored the references
after i store the references i did a while loop so i can traverse down that list n times so what i figured i needed was two linked lists,
one so that i could compare it and another one so that i could store the next references that are used for comparing
so what i did was did if the counter is == to zero or an even number i would do it one way then if it was an odd number i would switch.
So it could be consistent and i would get the correct outputs. 

My program doesnt run too slowly and i have a pic to prove it 
but since i cant post it on here since this doesnt allow pictures i will just type it.
it took .07 seconds to go down 3 tiers.


So what my program does is it finds the keyword titles, then it goes and looks at its references and then it will look though the gaint list of ALL the references and then it will find where the references == ID and will print it out. then it will keep on looping until you have reached the nth tier. 

The reason for that is so that the computer science students can see the paper that they need and see the inspiration that the article has used so they can get a deeper understanding of the topic in hand.
